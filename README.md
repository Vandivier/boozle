boozle is a set of tools for you to make your own game

## Game Building

1. Pick meta rule with optional meta-rule modifiers.
2. Decisionmakers then select game mechanics.
3. Assign turn order. The default turn order identification mechanic is everyone rolls a die in alphabetical name order and high roll goes first.
4. Take turns.
  1. Default turn content is to get 1 action point. That is, take 1 strategic action followed by 1 random action.
  2. If a player obtains additional action points, the ratio of strategic action to random action is determined by decisionmakers.

## base-game

1. decide game objective, default is "reach elite status, or most points in 15 turns"
2. decide turn order, default is card-draw number drawn in order of name
3. decide mechanics per turn (custom-cards are default mechanic)

## world map rules

1. make a world map out of bananagrams letters
2. units have 2 action points per turn default - can move, fight, search...
